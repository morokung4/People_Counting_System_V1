Code is in the ".gitignore" file
From orginally planned to use ESP32 but I couldn't find one nor have funds to buy it, also regarding the IR sensor I figure ultrasonic sensor would work better if the place where you're using it only has 1 entrance.
The Arduino, breadboard and the blue wire is school's property, other than that is my own components (the ultrasonic sensor and all the wires)
I tried to tune it to make it better quiet a few times but this is the best results I've got so far, maybe you could do it better than me if you want to do it.
I've got an idea that this would work great if I use it with the LCD or OLED but I don't have enough funds to buy it and I don't know where it is at school.
I want to use a better material other than the cardboard box but I was too broke to buy better materials.

**How to use**
Plug into the computer/ laptop and view it at Arduino IDE at the serial monitor tab
Walk from point 1 to point 2 = +1 (enter)
Walk from point 2 to point 1 = -1 (exit)
